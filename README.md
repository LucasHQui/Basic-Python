# Basic-Python 🐍

Python is a high-level, interpreted, and open-source programming language¹. Here are some basic concepts:

1. **Syntax**: Python uses a significant indentation approach, making the code more readable and easy to maintain¹. 📝
2. **Dynamic Typing**: In Python, you don't need to explicitly declare the type of a variable. The Python interpreter will infer the type based on the value assigned to the variable¹. 🔄
3. **Data Structures**: Python offers a variety of data structures, such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets¹. 📚
4. **Variables**: In Python, variables are used to store values that can be used later in the program¹. 📦
5. **Operators**: Python offers a variety of operators to perform calculations and manipulate values¹. ➕➖✖️➗
